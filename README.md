# Dot Files
My dot files shared between machines for FISH, ZSH, Bash on OSX.

## Installation
Customise the contents of `gitconfig-user`.
This is used for user-specific customisations of every other file.

Run [`script/setup`] after checkout to symlink (or copy) everything in this directory to your home directory.

## Status
I'm using these on all my personal machines.
